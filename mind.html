        <h1> A Healthy Mind</h1>
        <h2> Silence </h2>
        <ol>
<li>Give the mind time to move freely between thoughts.</li>
            
<li>Recognize the emotion fluctuations your body feels about certain things when your mind touches upon them.</li>
           
<li>This gives a better sense of who you are. What your morals and values are. Once you can clearly recognize this about yourself, your actions will begin to line up with your values and there will be less dissonance.</li>
          
<li>This dissonance can be described as that empty feeling you have, or
the unsettled tension you feel when you are alone. Many times we fill this void with more meaningless scenarios that distract us. But when we start at the root of the issue the silence won’t be as difficult.  We will feel confidence in the choices we are making because they are not ones to distract the mind but rather empower it.</li>
</ol>
        
        
        
<h2>Expressing Positive Emotions </h2>
    <ol>

	<li>Study showed that people with signs of depression had stronger reactions to inflicted illness.

            </li>
	
	<li>Viewing life in a positive nature brings positive natured occurrences.</li>
           
	<li>Seeing the good in a situation brings a state of peace and acceptance.</li>
           
	<li>We are not in control of the things happening externally, we only have our perceptions and control of our internal state.  By trying to change the external factors the struggle turns into a control issue.</li> <li>Saying “I will be happy when…” is only limiting yourself to external forces when so much power is within. You can tap into the powers within when you accept the ability for happiness in all situations. </li>
