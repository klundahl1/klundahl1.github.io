        <h1> A Healthy Body</h1>
        <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <ol>
<li>A happy mind will only thrive if the body is happy as well.  Giving it the natural endorphins by exerting yourself in physical fitness releases chemicals that make you feel happier. </li>
<li>Exercising increases the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the body which leaves the cardiovascular system working less and overall health.</li>
<li>Our bodies were designed for all types of physical exertion. Exercising the body by a variety of sports,  going for a walk, even something like hulahooping or jump roping moves the body. 
<li>Finding what moves you to move is important because everyone has a different relationship with their body and therefore different activities inspire/engage the mind as well.</li>
<li>The right mindset will make it a positive experience and will help make it more fun for more exercise in the future. Once the mind sees it as a chore, the body will act accordingly and exercise will be put on the backburner. </li>
            </ol>

     <h2>Eating natural and unprocessed foods </h2>
        <ol>
<li>Flavoring food without salt, eat less sugar, because what you put in you get out. </li>
<li>More greens, grains, protein.</li>
            </ol>.
<h2>Drink Water!</h2>
    <ol>
<li>Our body is between 50-65% water, we need to keep it replenished</li>
<li>Many of the issues in health come from dehydration.</li>
<li>Water is the answer to most external body pains. Headache? Drink water. Hungry? Drink water. </li>
<li>Many times our body confuses hunger with thirst because many foods naturally have amounts of water in them and hunger sometimes is our body telling us we just need a source of water.</li>
            </ol>
<h2>Breathe </h2>
    <ol>
<li>Shallow breaths taken are in response to stressful emotions.</li> 
<li>We tend to eat too quickly and talk too much.</li>
<li>By taking deep breaths we are encouraged to be silenced and listen to what is happening around us. This helps ground us, and link our outer experience with our inner experience. 
<li>Listening to others, we are able to quietly form our own opinions based off of theirs. We are all resources of knowledge for each other. Have the patience to learn.</li>
        </ol>
