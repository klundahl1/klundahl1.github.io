                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> I was born into a family of musicians and band directors so my exposure to aesthetic experiences began at a very young age. I picked my instrument, the French horn, and began my training. From Elementary school up until my senior year in High school, I practiced, competed, and performed my way into higher level musicianship. I earned a scholarship for French horn performance at the University of Florida. As I discovered more about myself in the unbound nature of college, I realized that my creativity had no ends. I began painting and experienced the same thrill I felt while playing my horn. The rush of images and colors inspired me just as musical passages did. Food was another medium for me to flex my right brain. I was able to engage my other two senses (smell and taste) when creating dishes. But I was creating for myself when I painted or cooked, I had no instant gratification of applause or my French horn professor's notes to basee my worth off of. It was liberating, it was freedom for me. So I switched majors my Junior year and chose to pursue a major that would challenge me to create in other ways, and kept French horn as a hobby.   </p>
