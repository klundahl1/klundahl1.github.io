                <h1> Title Page</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my website! A couple things to know before you begin your navigation through my life:
                    <ol>
                        <li>I am a student at the University of Florida</li>
                    
                        <li>My major is Telecommunications with a specialization of Media and Society </li>
                    
                        <li>In my case, curiosity did <em>NOT</em> kill the cat.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
            
                <h2>My Creative Juices</h2>
                <p> My claim to fame would be my ability to think creatively and out-of-the-box. I was born into a family of musicians and band directors so my exposure to aesthetic experiences began at a very young age. I picked my instrument, the French horn, and began my training. From Elementary school up until my senior year in High school, I practiced, competed, and performed my way into higher level musicianship. I earned a scholarship for French horn performance at the University of Florida. As I discovered more about myself in the unbound nature of college, I realized that my creativity had no ends. I began painting and experienced the same thrill I felt while playing my horn. The rush of images and colors inspired me just as musical passages did. Food was another medium for me to flex my right brain. I was able to engage my other two senses (smell and taste) when creating dishes. But I was creating for myself when I painted or cooked, I had no instant gratification of applause or my French horn professor's notes to basee my worth off of. It was liberating, it was freedom for me. So I switched majors my Junior year and chose to pursue a major that would challenge me to create in other ways, and kept French horn as a hobby.   </p>
                <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
                        <p>The past few semesters I have begun to take more of my major-related classes, sparking ideas of potential career routes. A lot of the classes look at the effect of media in our society, where I have come to learn how little research there is on it's sociological effects. I'm very interested in the demographics of media exposure: who watches what, why they watch what they do, and who has access to all the messages media is bombarding us with. My question is, with all of this access to information, and ease of publishing such "information", who is monitoring the content? We have the FDA recalling products we put into our body physically, but no one to filter the content we are constantly internalizing emotionally because it's much harder to come up with quantitative data in that department. My hopes would be to come up with a filter program of people who can analyze the pyschological and sociological effects of certain media messages and rightfully publishing them as warning labels. That way we are aware of what we are exposed to, and have professional studies that give us an insight on possible harm that these seemingly harmless campaigns companies promote. And that would only be the beginning. I would next attack the content on the internet and come up with a algorithm that protects our young from unwanted harmful information while keeping other's first amendment rights intact.
