                <h1> My Photos</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my website! A couple things to know before you begin your navigation through my life:
                    <ol>
                        <li>I am a student at the University of Florida</li>
                    
                        <li>My major is Telecommunications with a specialization of Media and Society </li>
                    
                        <li>In my case, curiosity did <em>NOT</em> kill the cat.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
            <aside>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="art.html">My Art</a></li>
                    <li><a href="art.html">My Food</a></li>
                    <li><a href="art.html">My Trip</a></li>
                
                </ul>
            
            
            </aside>
                <h2>Trip to Montana</h2>
            
"<img src="hotspring.jpg"  width="300" height="180" alt="Hotspring" title="Hot Spring in Yellowstone National Park" />
               
                <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
                        <p>The past few semesters I have begun to take more of my major-related classes, sparking ideas of potential career routes. A lot of the classes look at the effect of media in our society, where I have come to learn how little research there is on it's sociological effects. I'm very interested in the demographics of media exposure: who watches what, why they watch what they do, and who has access to all the messages media is bombarding us with. My question is, with all of this access to information, and ease of publishing such "information", who is monitoring the content? We have the FDA recalling products we put into our body physically, but no one to filter the content we are constantly internalizing emotionally because it's much harder to come up with quantitative data in that department. My hopes would be to come up with a filter program of people who can analyze the pyschological and sociological effects of certain media messages and rightfully publishing them as warning labels. That way we are aware of what we are exposed to, and have professional studies that give us an insight on possible harm that these seemingly harmless campaigns companies promote. And that would only be the beginning. I would next attack the content on the internet and come up with a algorithm that protects our young from unwanted harmful information while keeping other's first amendment rights intact.
